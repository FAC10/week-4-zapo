# Lazy Mad Libbers (a Zapo Project :neckbeard: :trollface:)

# User Stories

As a user who loves mad libs but has a terrible time coming up with words to use, I want to be able to:

> See a list of suggested words that match the madlib requirements i.e. adjectives, nouns etc.

> Be able to retain autonomy in terms of choosing what letter(s) I want the word to begin with.

As a student who is learning the differences between nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, I want to:

> See suggested nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs when I input letters so I can get more comfortable with the differences.

> Learn in an interactive and fun way.
